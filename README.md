Learn To Type Game - SDL Library

Programmer's Guide:
  1.) Try to use classes. Please please please use classes unless it's not necessary. 
  2.) INFIX NOTATION. Don't know what that is, you should:
    a.) Take a math class.
    b.) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation
  3.) If statements with &&, please do it like this:
    if(foo == "bar"
    && foobar = "barfoo"
    && barfoo = "foobar"
    )
    {
      //code
    }
    
    It's easier to read!
  4.) Keep things spaced out. 5 * 5 * 5 instead of 5*5*5. Just don't do it.. You won't be commited, and you'll have to fix it.
